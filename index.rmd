##  Submitting Coursework
- Do not submit your coursework via email.
- If anything goes wrong, please ask a question in Piazza or contact a course 
assistant.
- You can submit as many times as you'd like until the deadline: we will only 
grade the last submission.

## Regrade Requests

Regrade requests for Programming Assignments, Problem Sets, 
and Midterm are due within 1 week of receiving the graded work and must be 
submitted by posting a private question on Piazza.

  - We ask that you carefully review your assignments, reflect, and write a 
  short explanation justifying the reasons for a regrading request.
  - If a grade is contested and we realize that the marker made a mistake in the
  student's favour, the mark for that assignment may be lowered when the mistake
  is found. This would otherwise create a situation which is unfair to other
  students.
  - Please include your full name and UTORid in the body of the private note.
