<div id="what-you-need-in-order-to-make-the-most-of-this-course"
class="section level2">
<h2>What You Need in Order to Make the Most of This Course</h2>
<ul>
<li>Solid foundations in probability and statistics. It would be a good
idea to review your notes for STAB52 prior to the start of the course. I
will assume you are comfortable handling probabilities and
distributions, as well as making use of fundamental probability
results.</li>
<li>Solid foundations of Linear Algebra, including setting up and
solving systems of linear equations, matrices, vectors, inner products,
and matrix algebra.</li>
<li>Solid foundations of algorithms and data structures – you should be
able to implement common algorithms with ease, this includes graph-based
data manipulation, trees, recursive structures, and so on.</li>
<li>Solid skills in Python programming. Your programming assignments
make extensive use of Python, so you should be comfortable writing and
debugging python code.</li>
<li>It is always a good idea to review your notes for the courses that
cover the topics mentioned above to make sure you don’t miss out on
important concepts and ideas in lecture</li>

</div>
</div>
<div id="sylintegrity" class="container sec">
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>The University treats cases of cheating and plagiarism very
seriously. The University of Toronto’s <a
href="http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm">Code
of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a> outlines the behaviours that
constitute academic dishonesty and the processes for addressing academic
offences.</p>
<p>Potential offences in papers and assignments include using someone
else’s ideas or words without appropriate acknowledgement, submitting
your own work in more than one course without the permission of the
instructor, making up sources or facts, obtaining or providing
unauthorized assistance on any assignment.</p>
<p>On tests and exams, cheating includes using or possessing
unauthorized aids, looking at someone else’s answers during an exam or
test, misrepresenting your identity, or falsifying or altering any
documentation required by the University.</p>
<p>All of the work you submit must be done by you, and your work must
not be submitted by someone else. Plagiarism is academic fraud and is
taken very seriously. The department uses software that compares
programs for evidence of similar code. Please read the Rules and
Regulations from the U of T Governing Council, especially the Code of
Behaviour on Academic Matters.</p>
<p>Please also see the information for students from the Office of
Student Academic Integrity.</p>
<p>Please don’t copy. We want you to succeed and are here to help. The
simplest advice for avoiding plagiarism is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Never look at another student’s assignment solution, whether it
is on paper or on the computer screen. Never show another student your
assignment solution. This applies to all drafts of a solution and to
incomplete solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>If you find code/help/solution on the web that solves part or all
of an assignment, do not use or submit any part of it. A large
percentage of the academic offences in CS involve students who have
never met, and who just happened to find the same solution online. If
you find a solution, someone else will too.</p></li>
<li><p>Be very careful when engaging “tutoring services”. In previous
years, we had students suspended from the university as a result of
submitting work that was done with the “help” of such “tutors”. When in
doubt whether a tutoring company is offering real teaching or is helping
students cheat, do not hesitate to ask your instructor — we are here to
help!</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylplagiarism" class="container sec">
<div id="plagiarism-detection" class="section level2">
<h2>Plagiarism Detection</h2>
<p>Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to
the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual
similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students
will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the tool’s
reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of
detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of
this tool are described on the <a
href="https://teaching.utoronto.ca/resources/plagiarism-detection/">Centre
for Teaching Support &amp; Innovation</a> web site.</p>
<p>Students may wish to opt out of using the plagiarism detection tool.
In order to opt out, contact your instructor by email no later than two
(2) weeks after the start of classes. If you have opted out, then
specific information on an alternative method to submit your assignment
can be found below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylconsent" class="container sec">
<div id="informed-consent-email-lists" class="section level2">
<h2>Informed Consent – Email Lists</h2>
<p>As a student enrolled in this course, you understand that you are
providing your implicit consent to be included in an email list for the
department to send you non-essential information from time to time. If
you do not wish to be included in such an email list, please request to
be removed by contacting one of the Academic Advisors &amp;
Undergraduate Program Administrators. Their information can be found on
the MCS Website Contact Us <a
href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/contact-us-outreach">page</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylmissterm" class="container sec">
<div id="missed-term-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Missed Term Work</h2>
<p>In general, if work is missed due to an emergency situation, then the
weight of the work will be placed on other similar components in the
course. For example, a missed term test would add to the weight of the
final exam, and a missed assignment would add to the weight of a later
assignment. Exact accommodation will be discussed between the student
and the instructor, who must be informed within 72 hours of the due
date.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylremark" class="container sec">
<div id="remark-requests" class="section level2">
<h2>Remark Requests</h2>
<p>Remark requests are due within 1 week of receiving the graded work
and must be submitted by posting a private note on Piazza.</p>
<ul>
<li>We ask that you carefully review your assignments, reflect, and
write a short explanation justifying the reasons for a regrading
request.</li>
<li>If a grade is contested and we realize that the marker made a
mistake in the student’s favour, the mark for that assignment may be
lowered when the mistake is found. This would otherwise create a
situation which is unfair to other students.</li>
<li>Please include your full name and UTORid in the body of the private
note.</li>

<div id="accommodations" class="section level2">
<h2>Accommodations</h2>
<p>Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this
course. In particular, if you have a disability/health consideration
that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or
the AccessAbility Services Office as soon as possible.</p>
<p>AccessAbility Services staff (located in Rm AA142, Arts and
Administration Building) are available by appointment to assess specific
needs, provide referrals and arrange appropriate accommodations
416-287-7560 or email <a href="mailto:ability.utsc@utoronto.ca"
class="email">ability.utsc@utoronto.ca</a>. The sooner you let us know
your needs the quicker we can assist you in achieving your learning
goals in this course.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sylspecconsider" class="container sec">
<div id="special-consideration" class="section level2">
<h2>Special Consideration</h2>
<p>Please contact us immediately if you cannot complete coursework or
miss a test due to a major illness or other circumstances outside your
control. Special consideration will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
and is not given automatically. We may be unable to grant you exactly
the special consideration you seek, so please ensure we have time to
discuss your situation.</p>
<p>In order to receive special consideration, you must fill out a
Request for Special Consideration Form. Submit the form in PDF format as
soon as possible, together with any supporting documentation, to the
course instructor’s email address.</p>
<p>You can contact us (by email using the course instructor’s email
address) even before you have your documentation ready to submit; we
won’t be able to tell you at that point what accommodation you may
receive, but we can answer other questions and offer advice. It is
always easier to resolve situations earlier rather than later. If you
face a particularly disruptive situation that is likely to impact more
than one course, please contact your College Registrar. They are best
equipped to provide you with general advice and support that goes beyond
a single course.</p>

<div id="equity-diversity-and-inclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Equity, Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>The University of Toronto is committed to equity, human rights and
respect for diversity. All members of the learning environment in this
course should strive to create an atmosphere of mutual respect where all
members of our community can express themselves, engage with each other,
and respect one another’s differences. U of T does not condone
discrimination or harassment against any persons or communities.</p>
<p>The University of Toronto is a richly diverse community and as such
is committed to providing an environment free of any form of harassment,
misconduct, or discrimination. In this course, I seek to foster a civil,
respectful, and open-minded climate in which we can all work together to
develop a better understanding of key questions and debates through
meaningful dialogue. As such, I expect all involved with this course to
refrain from actions or behaviours that intimidate, humiliate, or demean
persons or groups or that undermine their security or self-esteem based
on traits related to race, religion, ancestry, place of origin, colour,
ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status,
disability, receipt of public assistance or record of offences.</p>

be useful to other students, e.g., about the course material,
assignments, general questions about course logistics and
administration), where you can ask the question while respecting the
academic integrity of the course (without revealing any idea or part of
a solution to a course assessment), please start a new topic directly on
the Piazza discussion forum, so that everyone can benefit from reading
your questions and the associated answers. We will monitor the forum
regularly, but feel free to answer questions from other students, too!
Helping someone else learn is one of the most effective ways to master a

<h2>University Land Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>I wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto
operates. For thousands of years, it has been the traditional land of
the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today,
this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from
across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work
on this land.</p>
